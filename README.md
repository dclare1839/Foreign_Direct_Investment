# Foreign_Direct_Investment
Make an analysis model for Foreign Direct Investment.

Find out the basic researches and articles to determine the independent variables which is affecting the dependent variables.
<br><br>
Considering the main topic is foreign direct investment, the candidates for independent variables are GDP, GDP per Capita, Population, Critical Events (Such as Pandemics), Interest Rate, Exchange Rate and so on.
<br><br>
To analyse the these correlations, it is the first thing to assume the basic model to assess the current Foreign Direct Investment figures. And it is impossible to analyse all of the countries in the world. Thus, it is necessary to choose some countries by reasonable criteria.
<br><br>
It is useless to analyse the bottom N countries by Total GDP or GDP per Capita. So, I am going to choose the most interesting 20 countries based on my subjective but reasonable points of view.
<br><br>
<b>1. United States</b> - In most cases, United States will be the investors, not a beneficiary. However, it is very important to analyse the in-and-out of the capital in United States. So, the net FDI figure will be very essential to analyse the current situation of United States.
<br><br>
<b>2. China</b> - In 2024, it seems pretty obvious that China will be in the depression in the near future. It is almost impossible to analyse and calculate every variable of China objectively due to its political situation. However, China is still open to Foreign Investors, and the trends of FDI in China will affect the whole economy of the world.
<br><br>
<b>3. Japan</b> - Japan is very fascinating country considering its the past 30 years. It was called "Lost Decades". Especially, these days, due to the lowest interest rate of Yen (Japanese Currency), Japan is getting more attention from the world.
<br><br>
<b>4. Republic of Korea</b> - Their territorial and political specialities are affecting their economy a lot. Especially, the potential possibility of War with North Korea, cannot be ignored to the investors. However, this kind of specialty cannot be quantified or on the database. Given that the impact of unstable situation in Republic of Korea, the analysis of it could show some meaningful results.
<br><br>
<b>5. Germany</b> - Germany is the leader of EU and they have difficulties in economy in the recent few years. Their difficulties were occurred by the war of Ukraine and Russia. Not only by this war, but also the bottlenecks that occurred during the transition between industries, the growth of economy in Germany is losing its power.
<br><br>
<b>6. United Kingdom</b> - Brexit was definitely the trigger to change the market of United Kingdom. The markets mean all the markets of Industries in United Kingdom. By excluding it from EU, the border became stricter and the fluidity of labour movement became more restricted. Considering that United Kingdom was the leader of Financial industry in Europe, these kinds of cashflow should be analysed.
<br><br>
<b>7. Ireland</b> - The most beneficial country of Brexit is definitely Ireland. Most of Multi-National Companies have moved to Ireland from United Kingdom. Two obviously helpful factors are that Irish are the native english speakers, and the corporate tax rate was relatively lower than in other countries.
<br><br>
<b>8. Romania</b> - Romania is one of the most growing countries in the terms of GDP.
